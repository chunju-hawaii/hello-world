# hello-world
This is my first step of Git-Hub
In order to obtain a better job in the near future, I decided to start learning how to use GitHub as a leverage.

My name is Chun-Ju as known as Jim. I am a Taiwanese, born and raised there.
Chun-Ju is my Chinese name, however it sounds like "Hanging there" in Mandarin Chinese if you pronounce "Chun-Ju" in English.
I got my bachelor's degree in Taiwan with Electronics Engineering major.
When I was discharged from the ARMY in the year of 2008, I decided to study abroad to pursue my master's degree.
Due to some major transformation issues, I startover from college majoring in Information Systems in the year of 2009.
After 5 years of hardworking as well as struggling, eventually I got both of bashelor's and master's degree from Hawaii Pacific University at Honolulu, Hawaii in the year of 2014.
